# README Generator [![readme-gen-pipeline](https://github.com/SLakehal27/readme-gen/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/SLakehal27/readme-gen/actions)

A simple README.md generator made in GoLang to generate README.md files for future GitHub projects.

## Why a README generator?

Sure, there are other tools to help generate README files that are already implemented and others that use AI for it.I see this project as a learning experience and an opportunity to make my own tooling with what I've learned so far.

## Usage

### Execution

```
go run .
```

### Testing

```
go test -cover -v
```
